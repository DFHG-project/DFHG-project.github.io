The <i>Digital Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</i> (DFHG) is the digital version of the five volumes of the <i>Fragmenta Historicorum Graecorum</i> edited by Karl Müller (1841-1873). The project provides not a new edition of Greek fragmentary authors, but a computational model for producing digital editions of ancient fragmentary authors and works. The DFHG project is complementary to the [Digital Athenaeus](http://digitalathenaeus.org/) project.

The repositories of this GitHub organization contain data about the 636 ancient Greek authors published in the FHG collection. 

For a catalog of fragmentary authors published in the FHG, see the [DFHG Fragmentary Authors Catalog](http://www.dfhg-project.org/Fragmentary-Authors-Catalog/). The project provides also the [Müller-Jacoby Table of Concordance](http://www.dfhg-project.org/Mueller-Jacoby-Concordance/), which is a search engine of authors published in the FHG including correspondences with other collections.

For a complete searchable catalog of the witnesses who preserve text reuses of the FHG authors, see the [DFHG Witnesses Catalog](http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/). The Catalog offers a [Witnesses Map](http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/map.php), a [Witnesses (Authors) Chart](http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/authors_chart.php), a [Witnesses (Works) Chart](http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/works_chart.php), and a [Witnesses Timeline](http://www.dfhg-project.org/Witnesses-Catalog/timeline.php). The Catalog includes also experimental text reuse detection. 

The project provides a complete list of FHG authors with corresponding `LOFTS urns` and `CITE urns`: see [DFHG_lofts_cite_urns](https://github.com/DFHG-project/DFHG-project.github.io/blob/master/dfhg_lofts_cite_urns.csv). On the use of LOFTS and CITE urns for citing FHG authors, read the homepage of the [DFHG project](http://www.dfhg-project.org).
